# Synchronized video streaming with Jamstack

This project demonstrates realtime messaging in Jamstack apps. Dubbed as a 'live watch party', this app allows a host to create a private watch party room, invite friends to it and watch videos together. They can also share live comments and see who's participating (online) in the party.

The host is able to choose a video from the available library.

 The host also has full control of the video playback for all participants, including play, pause and seek events.
